# 42 Piscine — C_06: Arguments and Program Execution

This repository contains my solutions for the **C_06 module** of the 42 Piscine curriculum.
The goal of this module is to build understanding of **command-line arguments**,
**program inputs**, and basic **program control** in C.

## 📍 Part of My 42 Learning Path

This module is part of the Piscine foundation that prepared me for
larger projects such as:

- push_swap
- minishell
- fdf
- minitalk

It represents an early stage of my progression toward low-level and system programming.

## 🧠 What This Module Covers

- Handling `argc` and `argv`
- Parsing and validating command-line arguments
- Controlling program behavior based on user input
- Basic error handling and return codes
- Defensive programming and edge-case handling

The focus is on understanding how C programs interact with the command line at runtime.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains individual exercises as standalone source files:

```
C_06/
├── ft_print_program_name.c
├── ft_print_params.c
├── ft_rev_params.c
├── C_06.pdf
└── README.md
```

- Each `.c` file corresponds to one exercise
- `C_06.pdf` contains the original subject and instructions

## 🛠 Examples of Assignments

Typical tasks in this module include:

- Printing the program name
- Displaying command-line parameters
- Reversing argument order
- Validating and formatting output

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

By completing this module, I improved my abilities in:

✔ Writing CLI-based C programs  
✔ Interpreting user input  
✔ Implementing clean control flow  
✔ Following strict coding standards  
✔ Writing readable and maintainable C code

## 📌 Notes

- Developed and tested on Linux
- Compiled using `gcc`
- Written according to 42 coding standards
- Manually tested with multiple input cases
