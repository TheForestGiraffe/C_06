# 42 Piscine — C_06: Arguments and Program Execution

This repository contains my solutions for the **C_06 module** of the 42 Piscine curriculum.
The goal of this module is to build understanding of **command-line arguments**,
**program inputs**, and basic **program control** in C.

## Part of My 42 Learning Path

This module is part of the Piscine foundation that prepared me for
larger projects such as:

- push_swap
- minishell
- fdf
- minitalk

It represents an early stage of my progression toward low-level and system programming.

---

## What This Module Covers

- Handling `argc` and `argv`
- Parsing and validating command-line arguments
- Controlling program behavior based on user input
- Basic error handling and return codes
- Defensive programming and edge-case handling

The focus is on understanding how C programs interact with the command line at runtime.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains individual exercises as standalone source files:

```
C_06/
├── ft_print_program_name.c
├── ft_print_params.c
├── ft_rev_params.c
├── C_06.pdf
└── README.md
```

- Each `.c` file corresponds to one exercise
- `C_06.pdf` contains the original subject and instructions

### Note on Repository Structure

For readability and transparency, the exercise files in this repository
are stored at the root level.

During the original 42 Piscine submission, all files were organized
according to the required structure (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.).

They were later flattened for easier browsing and code review.

## 🛠 Examples of Assignments

Typical tasks in this module include:

- Printing the program name
- Displaying command-line parameters
- Reversing argument order
- Validating and formatting output

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this module, I improved my abilities in:

✔ Writing CLI-based C programs  
✔ Interpreting user input  
✔ Implementing clean control flow  
✔ Following strict coding standards  
✔ Writing readable and maintainable C code

## Notes

- Developed and tested on Linux
- Compiled using `gcc`
- Written according to 42 coding standards
- Manually tested with multiple input cases
